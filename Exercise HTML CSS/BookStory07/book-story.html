        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an<br>
            hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of<br>
            <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> and all the other scientific<br>
            journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed<br>
            copy of <em>On The Road.</em> It had been Molly's favourite<br>
            book since college, and the longer she spent in these<br>
            four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
        </p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting<br>
            under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming<br>
            that Work is the refuge of people who have nothing<br>
            better to do.</p>
